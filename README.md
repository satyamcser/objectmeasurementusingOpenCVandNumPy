# objectmeasurementusingOpenCVandNumPy
“Object Measurement” is a program that we have used to calculate and display real-time object’s measurements. There are not many real-time object measurement models. 
Usually, it is a basic point of computer vision issues. As expressed, this extend presents a technique for computing the estimations of measurement of dimensions in real-time from images. 
To clarify its working it fundamentally employs a webcam and a white A4 sheet paper as a background to identify the object. After identifying the object, 
it shows its measurements in specified measuring units at real-time. Within the execution of the proposed method, 
we outlined a framework that utilized OpenCV and NumPy library. We used PyCharm IDE for programming the whole program.
